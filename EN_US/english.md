# 1.       Preface

We will propose a theory that cannot be scientifically proved temporarily. We call it “General Conservation of Energy Theory”. It can be said to be a hypothesis. It can also be understood as an ideology. This theory is not a religious belief, neither theism nor atheism. There is no propaganda agency such as a church, and there are no such personnel as missionaries. It is just for people to understand themselves better and what is going on around them.

# 2.       Question

The law of conservation of energy is a physics law proposed by Thomas Young in 1801. Also known as the first law of thermodynamics, it means that the total energy in a closed (isolated) system remains unchanged. In general, the total energy is no longer just the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy, but the total amount of static energy (intrinsic energy), kinetic energy, and potential energy.

If we follow the idea of the law of conservation of energy, can we understand things around us in macro view? Does people follow a kind of conservation of energy in individual attribute? What about a family? What about a country? What about universe? This article will try to explain this problem from the perspective of individual and family.

# 3.       Conservation of Individual Energy Theory

## 3.1.    Characteristics of energy

In personally view, it is assumed that everyone is composed of a certain amount of energy, which can be divided into three characteristics of energy: spiritual attributes, physical attributes, and social attributes. The measurement of energy’s characteristics is different. 

Spiritual attributes include happiness, sadness, love, hate, pain, perseverance, patience, calmness, madness, jealousy, tolerance, satisfaction and so on, which are subjective and psychological. Physical attributes include speed, strength, skill, flexibility, intelligence, body, sensitivity of each sense, physical characteristics of the body's various functions and so on, which are objective. Social attributes include family, friendship, marriage, wealth, power, reputation, work and other interactions with other people or things.

## 3.2.    Graphical representation of energy

Different attributes of energy’s characteristic are divided into positive energy or negative energy in subjective view. They can be represented by an "Energy Circle", which is containing a number of convex and concave peaks, as shown in Figure 1. The area of blue is sum of the energy of a person's current state. The convex and concave peaks on the surface of the circle represent positive or negative energy of different attributes, respectively. The black circle represents the threshold of death caused by negative energy. The red circle represents the threshold of death caused by positive energy. When ignoring spikes and thresholds, the diagram is similar to the capital letter "O", so it could be called "O-energy".

## 3.3.    Viewpoint

Focus on conservation of individual energy theory, we propose some viewpoints:

- In a short-term view, sum of energy of a person's three characteristics is basically the same.
- In a long-term view, sum of energy of a person's three characteristics is changing slowly.
- In objective view, different attribute of characteristic are connected.

- Any positive or negative energy which reach a certain threshold can lead to death.

- There is energy transmission between people and people, or people and things.

## 3.4.    Graphical representation of sum energy’s trend

A person can absorb or release energy (both positive and negative) from birth to death. From the fertilized egg to the time of birth, a person mainly absorbs energy from his parents. In the process of growing up, a person will absorb energy of his parents and other related people or things. When a person dies, his total energy is mainly released to relatives or other related people.

In general, the trend of people's total energy with age is shown in Figure 2. The energy circle trends of different ages are shown in Figure 3. If there is a death caused by some energy beyond threshold, the total energy will show a rapid decline at that point in time.

## 3.5.    Energy’s threshold

The threshold of the energy are always in a process of slowly-changing, ideally increasing or decreasing with age depending on attributes.

# 4.       Conservation of Family Energy Theory

## 4.1.    Combination

Defined from a family perspective, it consists mainly of parents and children. It is assumed that energy of family members being gathered in their new family is family’s "Energy Circle", and energy’s characteristics are basically the same as individual.

When two person form a new family, they take out part of energy belonging to the "Energy Circle" of their original family and make a new family’s "Energy Circle". At the same time, they still have some energy in the original family.

When many relatives form a larger family of interests, the total energy of "Energy Circle" is larger, some positive or negative energy may be higher, and anti-risk ability is stronger. As shown in Figure 4.

## 4.2.    Separation

As family members estranged from each other slowly, their family’s energy will be fewer and fewer. When a family is broken up for some reason, most of its energy will be taken away by individual members.

# 5.       Postscript

From single-celled organisms to humans today, this is the process of energy growing, which consistent with the evolution theory. The energy is coming from the earth or the universe. When energy accumulate to a new stage, it will produce a new species...
