General Conservation of Energy Theory

“What goes around comes around”, “Every dog has his day”, “Every man has his weak side”, “Fortune knocks once at least at every man’s gate”, all these proverbs are crystallizations of mankinds wisdom. In some way, they have described a deep viewpoint: balance. What is balance? Please read our post.

We will propose a theory that cannot be scientifically proved temporarily. We call it “General Conservation of Energy Theory”. It can be said to be a hypothesis. It can also be understood as an ideology. This theory is not a religious belief, neither theism nor atheism. There is no propaganda agency such as a church, and there are no such personnel as missionaries. It is just for people to understand themselves better and what is going on around them.
